# Mixed-Traffic Trunk Group Model  
**Teletraffic Engineering • Erlang-B • Retry Traffic • Dual-Link Calls • SS7 / PSTN**

This project implements an engineering traffic model for a mixed-voice trunk group
in a full-availability loss system. The model supports:

- Incoming single-link calls  
- Outgoing single-link calls with repeated-attempt behavior (retry traffic)  
- Dual-link (two-line) calls such as call forwarding / 3-party bridge  

It reflects operational conditions commonly observed in SS7 inter-network interfaces
and PSTN trunk groups, where mixed voice services compete for shared circuit resources.

## 🔬 Engineering Approach

The implementation follows classical teletraffic methodology with practical,
computation-efficient approximations:

- Stable recursive **Erlang-B** blocking formula  
- **Equivalent-load** representation for dual-link calls (each call uses two trunks)  
- **Fixed-point iteration** for retry traffic generated by failed outgoing calls  
- Performance metrics aligned with real-world trunk engineering workflows  

Instead of full state-space Markov models (which become intractable for large systems),
this approach provides an **engineering-grade approximation** suitable for large trunk
groups with hundreds or thousands of circuits.

## 📊 Output Metrics

The model computes:

- `A_total` — total offered load (including retries), Erlangs  
- `blocking_prob` — trunk group blocking probability (Erlang-B)  
- `outgoing_loss_prob` — end-to-end loss probability for outgoing calls  
- `retry_load` — load in Erlangs generated by repeated attempts  
- `carried_traffic` — carried traffic, Erlangs  
- `utilization` — average trunk utilization (mean busy trunks / V)  
- `iterations` and `converged` — fixed-point convergence information
